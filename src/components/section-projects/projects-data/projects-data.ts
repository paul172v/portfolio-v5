The back-end uses Express and Mongoose, does basic CRUD operations and also has some error handling and a handler factory to make the CRUD operations more streamlined. It uses over 20 models and the routes and controllers are divided between the main, kids and drinks menus. This was my first time making a 'proper' fullstack application but I am pleased with the results.",

I chose another menu & interface because I wanted to focus on getting used to TypeScript rather than figuring out a lot of logic or special features. There is a bit of authentication with JSON Web Tokens, validation and error handling on both the front and back end and I used bcrypt to hash passwords. For the back-end I added custom error handling and a  handler factory. For the frontend interface I used some keyframe animations for aesthetics and I used many of the fundamental hooks and conditional rendering for this project. The online menu is quite basic but that is because it is a recreation of a physical paper menu.",
